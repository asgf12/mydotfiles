Configs & stuff, pretty sure it's for my purpose only.

*WORK IN PROGRESS*, recommended to use with stow, or just symlinks.

~~**Coming soon**: merge all aliases to one file with good tests, add more package managers to upgrade function.~~
~~Syncing window managers and nvim configs when ready:~~

* ~~hyprland~~
* ~~waybar 4 sway & hyprland~~
* ~~sway~~
* Added some configs & edits from opensuse/cachyos
* nvim config often brakes, migrating to vim

### Status
* ~~podman~~
* ~~tmux~~
* ~~aliases~~ (mostly done)
  + ~~only defaultaliases hopefully~~
*  ~~bashrc/bash_profile~~ ~~(mostly done)~~ (lie, see more planing)
* ~~vim~~ (mostly done)
* Added some scripts and configuration needed to work, TODO clean it up and remove not nedded
* scripts:
  + ~~CHROMEBOOKLINUX~~
  + unzip script for future referance
  + organize

## More planing
bashrc modifications, added a snippet 'pure prompt', but it's using tput and grep with gnu flags (doesn't work in alpine linux for example), TODO: migrate to mostly pure bash, more branch learning

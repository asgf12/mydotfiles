Configs & stuff, pretty sure it's for my purpose only.

*WORK IN PROGRESS*, recommended to use with stow, or just symlinks.

### Status
* ~~podman~~
* ~~tmux~~
* ~~aliases~~ (mostly done)
  + ~~only defaultaliases hopefully~~
*  ~~bashrc/bash_profile~~ ~~(mostly done)~~ (lie, see more planing)
* ~~vim~~ (mostly done)
* Added some scripts and configuration needed to work, TODO clean it up and remove not nedded
* scripts:
  + ~~CHROMEBOOKLINUX~~
  + unzip script for future referance
  + organize

## More planing
~~bashrc modifications, added a snippet 'pure prompt', but it's using tput and grep with gnu flags (doesn't work in alpine linux for example), TODO: migrate to mostly pure bash, more branch learning~~
Bahsrc cleaned for use with distros without tput (thx gemini). Still have "errors" on termux(android) but it seems not fixable, waiting for linux on new android or update.
